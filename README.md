## Overview

This Guidance automates the entire capacity block lifecycle management process for organizations using AWS Capacity Blocks. It solves the challenges of manual capacity management by providing automated extension detection that continuously monitors capacity blocks approaching expiration, configurable approval workflows for capacity extensions, secure API management with RESTful API and authentication for programmatic access, and cost optimization that maintains optimal balance between on-demand and reserved capacity.

![Capacity Block Manager Architecture](diagram.png)

The Capacity Block Manager follows a serverless architecture:

1. **EventBridge Rule**: A scheduled EventBridge rule runs every minute, triggering the Capacity Block Manager Lambda function
2. **Lambda Function**: Scans DynamoDB for capacity block records and processes extensions based on configuration
3. **DynamoDB**: Stores capacity block records with configuration, status, and expiration details
4. **SNS Topic** (Optional): Sends approval notifications when required
5. **API Gateway**: Provides RESTful API for managing capacity block records with authentication
6. **Secrets Manager**: Securely stores API keys with automatic rotation

### Cost

   ```

## Deployment Validation

1. Open the CloudFormation console and verify the status of the template with the name `CapacityBlockManagerStack`

2. If deployment is successful, you should see:
   - A DynamoDB table with the name starting with `CapacityBlockManagerStack-CBJobTable`
   - Lambda functions for capacity block processing and API handling
   - An API Gateway with the name `CapacityBlock API`
   - A Secrets Manager secret for API key storage

3. Run the following CLI command to validate the deployment:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name CapacityBlockManagerStack --query "Stacks[0].StackStatus"
   ```
   
   Expected output: `"CREATE_COMPLETE"`

4. Test API connectivity:
   ```bash
   # Retrieve API key
   API_KEY=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id "/cbm/CapacityBlockManagerStack/apiSecretName" --query "SecretString" --output text | jq -r '.api_key')
   
   # Get API URL
   API_URL=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /cbm/CapacityBlockManagerStack/apiUrl --query "Parameter.Value" --output text)
   
   # Test API
   curl -X GET $API_URL -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

## Running the Guidance

### Guidance Inputs

The system processes capacity block records stored in DynamoDB with the following structure:

```json
{
  "PK": "unique-identifier",
  "capacity_block_id": "cr-1234567890abcdef0",
  "instance_type": "p4de.24xlarge",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "end_time": "2025-06-13T17:00:00Z",
  "extend_by_days": 7,
  "require_approval": false,
  "extension_lookahead_days": 2,
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

### Commands to Run

1. **Create a capacity block record via API**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST $API_URL \
     -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "PK": "test-capacity-block",
       "capacity_block_id": "cr-1234567890abcdef0",
       "instance_type": "p4de.24xlarge",
       "region": "us-east-1",
       "end_time": "2025-06-13T17:00:00Z",
       "extend_by_days": 7,
       "require_approval": false,
       "extension_lookahead_days": 2,
       "status": "ACTIVE"
     }'
   ```

2. **List all capacity block records**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET $API_URL \
     -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

3. **Use the test script** (requires Python and boto3):
   ```bash
   cd test
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python seed_compute_envs_via_api.py
   ```

### Expected Output

**API Response for successful creation**:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"message\":\"Item created successfully\",\"item\":{\"PK\":\"test-capacity-block\",\"capacity_block_id\":\"cr-1234567890abcdef0\",\"createdAt\":\"2024-12-25T16:00:00.000Z\"}}"
}
```

**Lambda Processing Logs** (visible in CloudWatch):
```
[INFO] Scanning table CapacityBlockManagerStack-CBJobTable...
[INFO] Retrieved 1 items from table
[INFO] Processing item: test-capacity-block
[DEBUG] Now: 2024-12-25T16:00:00.000Z, End: 2025-06-13T17:00:00Z, Lookahead: 2025-06-11T17:00:00Z
[INFO] Item test-capacity-block is not yet in extension window
```

### Output Description

- The system continuously monitors capacity blocks every minute via EventBridge
- When a capacity block approaches its expiration (within the lookahead window), the system automatically processes extension requests
- If approval is required, notifications are sent via SNS
- All processing activities are logged to CloudWatch for monitoring and troubleshooting

## Next Steps

To enhance this Guidance according to your requirements:

1. **Customize Extension Logic**: Modify the Lambda function in `src/extender/index.js` to implement custom extension logic based on your business rules

2. **Integrate with External Systems**: Use the API to integrate with existing capacity management or monitoring systems

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Add CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for capacity block metrics

4. **Multi-Region Support**: Deploy the stack in multiple regions for global capacity management

5. **Advanced Approval Workflows**: Integrate with AWS Step Functions for complex approval processes

6. **Cost Optimization**: Implement logic to analyze capacity utilization and optimize extension decisions

## Cleanup

1. Delete the CloudFormation stack:
   ```bash
   npx cdk destroy
   ```

2. Confirm deletion when prompted by typing `y`

3. Manually delete any remaining resources if needed:
   - CloudWatch log groups (if retention is set to never expire)
   - Any manually created capacity block reservations

4. If you used the approval workflow, unsubscribe from SNS notifications:
   - Go to the SNS console
   - Find the topic created by the stack
   - Unsubscribe your email address

## FAQ, known issues, additional considerations, and limitations

### Known Issues

**Issue**: API Gateway returns 403 Forbidden
**Resolution**: Ensure the API key is correctly retrieved from Secrets Manager and included in the `x-api-key` header

**Issue**: Lambda function timeout during capacity block processing
**Resolution**: The function has a 30-second timeout. For large numbers of capacity blocks, consider implementing pagination or increasing the timeout

### Additional Considerations

- This Guidance creates API endpoints that require API key authentication. Ensure API keys are properly managed and rotated
- The EventBridge rule runs every minute, which may generate CloudWatch logs. Monitor log retention settings to manage costs
- Capacity block extensions are subject to AWS availability and pricing at the time of extension
- The approval workflow requires manual confirmation of SNS email subscriptions

### Limitations

- The system processes capacity blocks sequentially, which may impact performance with large numbers of reservations
- Extension decisions are based on time-based rules only; utilization-based extensions require custom implementation
- The solution is designed for single-account capacity management; cross-account scenarios require additional IAM configuration
